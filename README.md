# Todo's!
___

## Overview
A MERN stack application where user's register/login/logout of an account and create, view, update, search and delete their Todos! All REST API routes are authorized and authenticated via JSON Web Tokens (JWT's).

When users create a todo, they enter a title, description, and YouTube URL associated with their todo. Each todo is then accessible via the get-todo page where they can be viewed, updated, or deleted.

Upon a successful key word or phrase search, matching todo's are displayed on the search page where they can also be viewed, edited, and deleted.

To demo this application: 

1. Vist the deployed link [here](https://nmcconnell-todo.herokuapp.com/) 
2. Login with Email: user@user.com and Password: useruser.  
3. Or, register an account and create your own todos! 

Future development will improve search functionality with the implementation of tags at todo creation.
