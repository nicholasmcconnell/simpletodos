# Todo's!
___

## Overview
A MERN stack application where user's register/login/logout of an account and create, view, update, search and delete their Todos!  All REST API routes are authorized and authenticated via JSON Web Tokens (JWT's).

When users create a todo, they enter a title, description, and YouTube URL associated with their todo.  Each todo is then accesible via the create todo page where they can be viewed, updated, or deleted.  

Upon a succesfull key word or phrase search, matching todo's are displayed on the search page where they can also be viewed, edited, and deleted.

To demo this application, vist the deployed link [here](https://nmcconnell-todo.herokuapp.com/) and login with email: user@user.com and password: useruser.  Or, register an account and create your own todos!
