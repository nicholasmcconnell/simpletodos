# Simple Todo's!
___

## Overview
A MERN stack application for creating, viewing, updating, searching and deleting user Todos. All REST API routes are authorized and authenticated via JSON Web Tokens (JWT's) and  login credentials.

When users create a todo, they enter a title, description, and YouTube URL. Each todo is then accessible via the get-todo page where they can be viewed, updated, or deleted.

A successful key word or phrase search renders todos to the search page to be viewed, edited, and deleted.

Future development will display stores and services helpful to completing user todo's via Google Maps Platform.

To demo this application: 

1. Vist the deployed link [here](https://nmcconnell-todo.herokuapp.com/) 
2. Login with Email: user@user.com and Password: useruser.  
3. Or, register an account and create your own todos!
